score = 0
height = 1.9
isWinning = True

print(
    f"Your score is {score}, Your height is {height}, You're winning right? {isWinning}")


'''
In the code snippet, \
I initialized three variables: score, height, and isWinning.
The score variable is set to 0, representing a player's score in a game.
The height variable is assigned a value of 1.9, representing the player's height in meters.
Finally, the isWinning variable is set to True, indicating that the player is currently winning.

To display the values of these variables, I used a formatted string using the print function.
The string includes placeholders that are replaced with the values of the variables.
The output of this code snippet would be:

"Your score is 0, Your height is 1.9, You're winning right? True
