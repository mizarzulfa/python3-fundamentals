---------------
Looping and String Concatenation with Vegetables

Description:
In this Python code, you will learn how to use a loop to iterate over a list of vegetables and perform some actions with each item.
The code will print the vegetable's name and then concatenate it with the word "bro" to create a new string.
This exercise will help to understand the basics of loops, string manipulation, and list iteration in Python.

Learning Focus:
- Looping over a list using a for loop
- Printing values within a loop
- Concatenating strings

Code Explanation:
1. The variable `vegetables` is initialized as a list containing the names of various vegetables.
2. The `for` loop is used to iterate over each item in the `vegetables` list.
3. Inside the loop, the current vegetable's name is printed using the `print` function, which displays the value on the screen.
4. The `+` operator is used for string concatenation. By adding the string " bro" to each vegetable's name, a new string is created.
5. The concatenated string is printed using the `print` function.
6. The loop continues until all the vegetables in the list have been processed.

By running this code, you will see each vegetable's name followed by the concatenated string, which appends " bro" to each vegetable's name.
This exercise demonstrates how to perform actions on each item in a list using a loop, and how to manipulate strings in Python.
