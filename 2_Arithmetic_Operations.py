# Initialize the variable

# Perform arithmetic operations
easy_peasy /= 10  # Divide by 10
easy_peasy += 5   # Add 5

'''
This code demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Python.
It performs a series of calculations on the variable easy_peasy and prints the result.

^ Explanation ^
- The variable easy_peasy is initialized with a value of 90.
- The /= operator performs division and assignment in one step. easy_peasy /= 10 divides easy_peasy by 10 and updates its value to the result (9.0).
- The += operator adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. easy_peasy += 5 adds 5 to easy_peasy and updates its value to 14.0.
- The *= operator multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. easy_peasy *= 5 multiplies easy_peasy by 5 and updates its value to 70.0.
- The /= operator is used again to divide easy_peasy by 4.2 and update its value to 16.666666666666668.
- The round() function is used to round the value of easy_peasy to 2 decimal places.
- The rounded value of easy_peasy (16.67) is printed to the console
