def addition(number: int, number2: int) -> int:
    return number + number2

# The addition function takes in two integer arguments and returns their sum.
    # The return statement in a function specifies the value that the function should result in and pass back to the caller.
    # the return statement return number + number2 specifies that the function should return the sum of number and number2.
    # calling addition(2,3), it will return the value 5, which you can store in a variable or use in your code as needed.

def addition2(number: int, number2: int):
    print(number + number2)

# The addition2 function takes in two integer arguments and prints their sum.
    # 'addition2' function does not have a return statement. Instead, it uses the print function to display the sum of number and number2 directly to the console.
    # It doesn't return any value that can be stored in a variable or used in other parts of the code.

# Summary:
# - "addition" returns the sum of two integers.
# - "addition2" prints the sum of two integers but does not return a value.
